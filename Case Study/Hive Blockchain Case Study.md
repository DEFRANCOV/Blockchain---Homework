# CASE STUDY:  HIVE

## Business Strategy

Hive is a public company and accordingly is accountable to its shareholders.   Its main business is operating as a large scale blockchain miner.   Miners earn income when they solve the computational problem of decoding messages. Their current strategy is to quickly acquire, develop and operate blockchain mining facilities in cool climates and politically/economically stable jurisdictions.


## Electricity Consumption:  A Challenge for Blockchain

The benefits of blockchain are well known.   It increases transparency, improves security, and empowers everyday citizens by mitigating the power (political or economic) of central authorities/corporations who have historically built large, centralized proprietary repositories of information. 

One drawback of blockchain technology is the energy intensity of all the connected nodes, particularly the miners.   Miners are energy intensive for two reasons.   First, miners compete with each other, 24X7, to solve computational problems.   Second, perpetually active computers require cooling which in turn requires further electricity.  

It is estimated that mining consumes 77.8 terawatt hours/year which is the equivalent of the total energy consumption of the Netherlands or Czech Republic.   While renewable energy is still growing, today much electricity generation is still reliant upon natural gas, oil, coal and nuclear sources.    That mean carbon emissions for gas, oil and coal.  In the case of nuclear, that means living with the social risk of nuclear facility accidents and dealing with the long-term ecological consequences of storing radioactive waste.

As the use of blockchain technology is growing rapidly, the energy intensity challenge will grow as well.

According to Digiconomistâ€™s Bitcoin energy consumption tracker, mining currently consumes 77.78 terawatt-hours per year. That is comparable to the total energy consumption of countries such as the Netherlands and the Czech Republic.


## Hive Addresses the Electricity Challenge

Hive runs all its mining facilities in low temperature jurisdictions, (Canada, Sweden and Iceland) and its facilities only use renewable energy.   Low temperature translates into less cooling requirements.   This is one facet that lowers their cost structure and improves returns for shareholders.   The use of renewable energy also addresses the social issue of reducing carbon emissions.

Its mining facilities are in stable jurisdictions.   In this case stable means (relatively) political transparency and strong rule of law.    Accordingly, this decreases political risk for shareholders.


## Plenty of Upside

As discussed above, the use of blockchain is expanding rapidly.   The global blockchain technology is forecasted to grow at a 69% CAGR from 2019 to 2025.   The number of bitcoin addresses that hold at least 1 bitcoin has grown from approximately 20,000 in 2009 to 800,000 in 2020.    The exploding price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies is generating further interest and will likely augment the 69% CAGR.  Located in geographies with low energy costs, and cooler climates, Hive is well positioned to leverage the growing revenues associated with expanding use of blockchain technologies.
